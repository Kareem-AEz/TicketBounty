## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### Architecture

```
API Handler → inngest.send() → Inngest Queue → Workflow Functions
                 (fast)         (reliable)      (with retries)
```

### Core Pattern

```typescript
// 1. Define event type
import { eventType, staticSchema } from "inngest";

export const featureActionEvent = eventType("app/feature.action", {
  schema: staticSchema<{
    // your fields
  }>()
});

// 2. Create workflow
export const workflow = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "feature-action" , triggers: [{ event: featureActionEvent }] },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const result = await step.run("do-it", async () => {
      return await doSomething(event.data);
    });
    return result;
  }
);

// 3. Register in handler
export const { GET, POST } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [workflow, ...],
});

// 4. Emit event
await inngest.send(featureActionEvent.create({ data: {...} }));
```

### 10 Best Practices

1. Decouple with events
2. Use steps for everything
3. Name clearly
4. Handle errors globally
5. Think async-first
6. Design for retries
7. Monitor observability
8. Set timeouts
9. Control concurrency
10. Test thoroughly
